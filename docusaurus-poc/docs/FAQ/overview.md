## General Information

### What changed in the process of submitting SARs as of January 1, 2020?

Since January 1, 2020, suspicious activity reports and other information are no longer transmitted to MROS by fax, but through the new data processing system goAML.

### Where can I find more information about goAML?

Further information about goAML is regularly published on the following [MROS webpage](https://www.fedpol.admin.ch/fedpol/en/home/kriminalitaet/geldwaescherei/meldung.html).

System-related information can also be found on the UNODC website for [goAML](https://goaml.unodc.org/).

Please note that the information published on the UNODC site is of a general nature and does not address country-specific adaptations by MROS. For this, please refer to the MROS website.

### Is a financial intermediary obliged to register in goAML under all circumstances?

There is no general obligation to register in goAML. MROS recommends that financial intermediaries subject to reporting obligations only register for the use of goAML when they want or need to submit a suspicious activity report or respond to an Art. 11a inquiry from MROS.
