# Registration in goAML

## Two-Factor Authentication

### Why was two-factor authentication introduced for goAML?

To improve the already high security standard, MROS has introduced an additional two-factor authentication for external users logging into goAML.

The corresponding registration page is available on the internet at:

A detailed step-by-step guide for the registration process is available on our homepage.

## Password Management

### Can I change my goAML password myself?

No, as the password is stored in a separate system, we always need a written request to goaml.info@fedpol.admin.ch. The LoginID must be provided.

### What should I do if I can't log in after entering my password?

First, clear your browser's history (cache) and restart it. If this doesn't work despite entering the correct password, contact us via goaml.info@fedpol.admin.ch and we will provide you with a temporary password.

### I haven't logged into goAML for a long time and my login attempt was unsuccessful.

The settings in the security portal (SSO) are such that an account is deactivated six months after the last successful login. Please contact MROS via goaml.info@fedpol.admin.ch and your account will be unlocked.

### I am registered as a goAML admin. Can I create new accounts for my colleagues?

No, with the implementation of 2-factor authentication, this is not possible. All new users must therefore fill out the application form published on our website:
