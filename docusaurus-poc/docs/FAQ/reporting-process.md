# Reporting Process

## Manual Reporting

### What does the process for manual entry of a report in goAML look like and how time-consuming is it?

Manual data entry (whether in connection with a suspicious activity report or due to a request for information under Art. 11a para. 1 and 2 or 3 AMLA) can be done directly via the internet by persons registered as users in the system. The relevant information must be entered online and the individual fields filled out. Depending on the type of report, manual entry can be time-consuming, especially if many transactions need to be recorded. The entry is done completely online without the use of additional third-party systems.

Information on other entry options can be found on the internet at:

## Transaction Reporting

### Must all transactions be submitted electronically?

All suspicious transactions (up to a maximum of 100 transactions) should be submitted in electronic form. This means that they must either be entered completely manually or semi-automatically (see question 27 in the original FAQ) in goAML or can be transmitted via XML file.

Please also consult our letter "Adjustments to the practice for reports via goAML" dated April 1, 2021 (found here under the Documents tab).

### Is it sufficient to report only the suspicious transactions, or must all transactions falling within a specific time period be submitted?

Yes, only the suspicious transactions are required (up to a maximum of 100 transactions). The report text must explicitly justify why the financial intermediary knows or suspects that the assets involved are of criminal origin. MROS can at any time exercise its right under Art. 11a para. 1 AMLA to subsequently request additional information, including on transactions, from the reporting financial intermediary to complete the received report. These transactions must also be submitted to MROS via goAML.

For more detailed information on the reporting process, including XML file submission and semi-automated reporting, please refer to the original FAQ document.

## Termination Notifications

### How should I proceed as an account-holding bank if I need to report the termination of a business relationship in accordance with Art. 9b AMLA?

Termination notifications according to Art. 9b AMLA can be reported either via notification through the Message Board in the goAML web portal or via a specific report type (CANCL or CANCT), also in the goAML web portal under the "New Reports" menu.

### Do I receive a confirmation of receipt from MROS after submitting a termination notification in accordance with Art. 9b AMLA?

No, in neither of the two notification options mentioned in point 31 of the original FAQ does the reporting financial intermediary receive a confirmation of receipt from MROS. The transmission data recorded in the goAML web portal (Message Board notification -> see screenshot in the above-mentioned instructions; notifications via report CANCL/CANCT -> status "Processed") serve as proof of successful transmission to MROS.

MROS reserves the right to return incorrectly or incompletely recorded termination notifications to the financial intermediary for revision.
