# Technical Requirements and Data Security

## System Requirements

### What technical requirements must be met to use goAML?

For manual reporting, an internet connection and personal login data are sufficient to log into the web-based input tool. This requires prior registration as a goAML user.

For semi-automated (see question 27 in the original FAQ) or automated report creation, it is assumed that the financial intermediary has developed an internal IT solution that ensures the XML file is created in the structure defined by MROS (the structure is published on the Internet in the document "Standard XML Reporting â€“ Instructions and Specifications for goAML": [https://www.fedpol.admin.ch/fedpol/en/home/kriminalitaet/geldwaescherei/meldung.html](https://www.fedpol.admin.ch/fedpol/en/home/kriminalitaet/geldwaescherei/meldung.html)).

### Which web browsers are supported by goAML?

Currently, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge (Chromium; only from 2020 version) are supported for using goAML. Internet Explorer IE and older Edge versions cannot be used.

## XML and Data Formats

### What does "XML" mean?

"XML" is an IT language used to structure large amounts of data (e.g., a suspicious activity report).

### In which formats can attachments be submitted?

The accepted formats are *.zip; *.xml; *.txt; *.tif; *.tiff; *.bmp; *.doc; *.docx; *.pdf; *.jpg; *.xls; *.xlsx; *.ppt; *.pptx; *.png; *.rtf.

Users are asked to always apply optical character recognition (OCR). The maximum size per attachment is 20 MB.
