# Data Security

## Data Protection Measures

### How secure is the data stored in the new data processing system?

The submitted data is transferred via a secure HTTPS connection from the financial intermediary to the "Demilitarized Zone" (DMZ). The DMZ is located outside the federal network and is protected by firewalls, encrypted communication, anti-virus software, and user identification via two-factor authentication. At regular, short intervals, the completed reports are transferred from the DMZ to the federal network via a one-sided "data retrieval mechanism (pull)" and deleted in the DMZ. In the federal network, the data is strictly protected by advanced IT security measures.

### Is personal data of goAML users passed on to third parties?

No. At no time is personal information of registered goAML users passed on to any third parties.

When MROS transmits a suspicious activity report to a law enforcement agency, the details of the reporting compliance staff will not be visible.

### Can UNODC access MROS data?

No, this is never the case. UNODC is merely the software provider but is not legally allowed to view or access MROS data at any time.

## Data Retention and Accessibility

### Is it possible to view or download a report that has already been archived?

No, once a report is shown as "archived", there is no possibility to view or download it again. It is therefore important to save a local copy immediately after sending a report.

### Why can't I view or save a submitted report or a Message Board message for my records anymore?

For security and storage capacity reasons, reports and Message Board messages, including attachments, are automatically deleted by the system within a certain time frame.

The deletion periods are as follows:
- Submitted reports: 7 days after submission
- Rejected reports that have already been moved to draft status: 7 days
- Report drafts: 14 days
- Message Board messages: 30 days
