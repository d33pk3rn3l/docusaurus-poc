## About This Documentation

This unofficial documentation is a proof-of-concept demonstration of how the goAML FAQ could be structured in a Docusaurus-style documentation site. It is based on publicly available information but has been reorganized and reformatted for clarity and ease of navigation.

The content is divided into several sections:

- [Overview](FAQ/overview.md)
- [Registration](FAQ/registration.md)
- [Technical Requirements](FAQ/technical-requirements.md)
- [Reporting Process](FAQ/reporting-process.md)
- [Data Security](FAQ/data-security.md)

Please note that while efforts have been made to maintain accuracy, this unofficial documentation may contain errors, omissions, or outdated information. Always verify critical information with official sources.

## Feedback and Corrections

As this is an unofficial proof of concept, there is no formal feedback or correction process. In a real-world scenario, such a documentation site would typically include information on how to submit feedback, report errors, or suggest improvements.

Remember: For any official inquiries or concerns about goAML or suspicious activity reporting, always contact MROS directly through official channels.
